# AHK-NT8 Trade Execution Bridge

This project provides a file-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) bridge between Ensign DYO and NinjaTrader 8 (NT8) using AutoHotkey (AHK). It monitors signals generated by technical indicators and automates order execution via keyboard hotkeys.

## Critical Prerequisite

NinjaTrader 8 must be running and the target window (e.g., SuperDOM or Chart) must be open before launching the AHK script. The script identifies the NT8 process to send hotkey commands (F4 or F9). If the application is not running, the script will be unable to focus the window or execute trades.

## Data File Specifications

The system relies on four primary text files to manage logic, safety, and metadata.

### 1. instrument.txt (Instrument Information)
* Purpose: Defines the specific trading instrument currently being monitored.
* Format: ASCII Plain Text (e.g., MES MAR26).
* Example:
MES MAR26 
MNQ JUN26 
ES MAR26
* Usage: Used for logging purposes and to verify that the signal matches the intended market before execution.

### 2. account.txt (Account Information)
* Purpose: Specifies the target trading account for the session.
* Format: ASCII Plain Text (e.g., Sim101).
* Usage: Ensures that the automation is interacting with the correct account context within NinjaTrader.

### 3. status.txt (The Safety Gate)
* Purpose: Controls the execution state of the bridge.
* Content:
    * CLEAR: The script is authorized to send hotkeys to NT8.
    * BUSY: The script will ignore any incoming signal.txt and delete it without sending commands.
* Note: This file is managed by the Consul Helper to ensure orders are only sent when the system is ready.

## Workflow Logic

1. Detection: Ensign DYO writes a command to signal.txt.
2. Validation: AHK detects the file and immediately checks status.txt.
3. Execution:
    * If status.txt is CLEAR, AHK activates the NT8 window and sends the mapped Hotkey.
    * If status.txt is BUSY, the signal is discarded.
4. Cleanup: signal.txt is deleted to reset the trigger state. (Ensure DYO)

## Getting Started

1. Ensure NinjaTrader 8 is running and configured with F4/F9 hotkeys.
2. Verify that instrument.txt and account.txt contain the correct session data.
3. Run the TradeBot.ahk script.
4. Monitor the system tray or ToolTips for real-time status updates.
